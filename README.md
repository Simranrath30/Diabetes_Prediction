# Diabetes_Prediction
This project builds a Supervised Machine Learning model to predict diabetes risk based on patient health parameters. The model uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and is trained on a structured medical dataset.
Features & Methodology
âœ… Dataset: Includes patient data such as Glucose Level, Blood Pressure, BMI, Insulin, Age, etc. /n
âœ… Standardization: Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature values, ensuring the model performs optimally on different scales of data. /n
âœ… Model Used: SVM (Support Vector Machine) for binary classification (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic).
âœ… Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy
Results & Insights
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 77.27% on the test dataset. Feature importance analysis showed that Glucose Level and BMI were strong predictors of diabetes risk. The model effectively differentiates between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, making it a promising tool for early diagnosis.
Future Enhancements
To improve the accuracy (currently 77.27%), the following techniques can be implemented:

ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering â€“ Identify and add more relevant features (e.g., lifestyle factors, diet, genetic history) to improve predictions.
ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Optimize SVM parameters (kernel type, C value, gamma) using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
ðŸ”¹ Data Augmentation â€“ Use synthetic data generation techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalances.
ðŸ”¹ Ensemble Learning â€“ Combine SVM with Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for better predictive power.
ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning Integration â€“ Implement ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) for capturing complex patterns in medical data.
ðŸ”¹ Larger & More Diverse Dataset â€“ Train the model on a bigger dataset with more diverse patient demographics for better generalization.
ðŸ”¹ Flask-Based Web App â€“ Deploy the model as an interactive web application for real-time diabetes prediction.
